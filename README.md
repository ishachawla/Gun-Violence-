# <center> Gun Violence in the US </center>

##### The US has a long and a very painful history of gun violence. Through this project we are trying to understand the reason behind the rise of it and it's ill affects on the citizens. 
****
### The data on gun violence has been divided into 3 segments: 
1. Gun violence in the US based on gender and type of abuse
2. Gun laws effecting gun violence across the US states
3. US compared to other countries in the world
****
### How to Run:
1. Gun violence in the US based on gender and type of abuse

* _Step 1_: Run the file Gun-Violence.ipynb
<a> https://github.com/ishachawla/Gun-Violence-/blob/master/Gun-Violence.ipynb </a>
> This part primarlily focuses on Gun -Violence in America how it affects people, a statewise deepdive ranging from domestic violence to gun ownership.

* _Step 2_: BayesianApproach.ipynb
<a> https://github.com/ishachawla/Gun-Violence-/blob/master/Bayesian_Approach.ipynb </a>
> Leveraging MCMC to build a model that can efficiently understand the priors for each states and build a model that can be used to forecast what the future can hold.

2. Gun laws effecting gun violence across the US states
* _Step 1_: Run NN_lawsVScrude_rate.ipynb
3. US compared to other countries in the world
* _Step 1_ : Run global.ipynb
